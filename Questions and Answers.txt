Question: 
Chicken Ingot does not appear in the inventory (not initialized)

Answer (resolved by myself and posted in Q&A):
There were no compile errors. However, the "Chicken Ingot" would not appear in the inventory. 
My Dad spent some time debugging this issue and it turns out that the "chicken_ingot" was not being initialized. 
Also, the mod info was not being properly displayed in the Mods area within Minecraft. 
Could you please make a note for your audience? Otherwise, great job! Thanks!
